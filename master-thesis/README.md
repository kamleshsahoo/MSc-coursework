## Scope
This study enhances Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF), a medical imaging technique. The developed method reduces imaging errors (artefacts) and improves accuracy by using advanced mathematical techniques. This optimized approach increases the precision of tissue property analysis, with significant improvements seen in $T_2$ and $T_1$ maps, as well as proton density reconstructions. In addition, it reduces data collection time, making it a potentially more efficient imaging protocol for clinical use.
