# Sentiment detection and Neural Langugae Models (NLMs)
This project consists of two parts:
- Optimizing sentiment classification techniques
  - unsupervised (lexicon based)
  - supervised (Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines)  
  on a movie reviews dataset, using standard NLP techniques such as stemming and including n-grams and reporting the algorithmic complexity for each approach.
- Developing Neural language models such as
  - Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBoW)
  - Deep CBoW
  - Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)  
  to obtain sentence representations from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and used them for downstream tasks like summarization and sentiment classification.
