# Advanced Topics in Computational Finance
## Scope: To study discretization techniques to approximate the numerical solution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

In this work, we investigate two prominent option pricing models, namely the Black-Scholes model with constant volatility and the Heston model, which incorporates stochastic volatility. Employing Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the efficacy of both the Euler-Maruyama (EM) and Milstein schemes in pricing path-independent European options and path-dependent Barrier options.
