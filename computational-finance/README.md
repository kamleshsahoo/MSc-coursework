- *Assignment 1*: 
  - Implement the Binomial Tree and Black-Scholes Model to option pricing and perform hedging simulations.
- *Assignment 2*: 
  - Apply Monte-Carlo methods (MC) to derivative pricing and estimate the senstivities involved in MC methods. 
  - Apply variance reduction techniques and quasi-Monte Carlo methods to accelerate numerical valuation of financial derivatives.
- *Assignment 3*: 
  - Apply Finite Difference Methods (FDM) to Black-Scholes model to estimate the price of European-style options.
    - Two FDMs were used for the Black-Scholes equation: FTCS (Forward Time Centered Space) and  CN (Crank  Nicolson).
