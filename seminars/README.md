Assignment for Seminars Lecture on Team-based Coding Projects

Instructions:
1. Fork this repository.

2. Add your group member(s) as collaborators to your repo

3. Do the assignment (together):
Clone the repository to your workstation and open assigment_1.py in your favorite editor (all group members). Follow the instructions in the script.
When you are finished, you split up for assignment 2. One of you opens 2a, the other two do 2b and 2c (if you are a group of two, the same person does 2b and 2c).
Everyone follows the instructions in their script. Once you have pushed all your changes, continue.

4. Create a pull request for me to this (original) repo. (Hint: you can use the "New pull request" button and then do a "compare across forks").
