# Stochastic simuulation
The course consists of 3 projects, building on the foundations of probability theory, while setting up stochastic models to simulate various real-world systems from finance, to supply chain to biomedicine
- Compute the Area of the Mandelbrot Set, using Monte Carlo (MC) Integration and improve the convergence of MC approach using different sampling approaches:
  - Pure random sampling,
  - Latin hypercube sampling,
  - Orthogonal sampling
-  Discrete Event Simualtion (DES) using Queuing Theory
    -  A computer simulation model for improving queuing systems using DES and propose the most efficient queuing system.
-  Solving Traveling Salesman Problem using Simulated Annealing
    - Implemented the method of Simulated Annealing to solve a 280-node Traveling Salesman Problem and analyse the convergence of solutions using linear, exponential, and logarithmic cooling schedules and varied the Markov chain lengths.
